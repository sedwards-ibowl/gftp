# gFTP Changelog - Recent Changes

## 2024-12-12 - macOS Improvements

### Fixed: SSH/SFTP Crash on macOS (Threading Issue)

**Problem**: When connecting to SSH/SFTP servers, gftp-gtk would crash with `EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)` when trying to show host key verification dialogs. The crash occurred because GTK dialog windows were being created from background threads, which is not allowed on macOS.

**Solution**: Modified `gftpui_protocol_ask_yes_no()` to properly schedule dialog creation on the main thread using `g_idle_add()`:
- Created `YesNoDialogData` structure to pass data between threads
- Added `_create_yes_no_dialog_on_main_thread()` callback that runs on main thread
- Removed deprecated `GDK_THREADS_ENTER/LEAVE` macros
- Ensured all GTK GUI operations happen on the main thread

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gtk/gtkui.c:526-587` - Rewrote `gftpui_protocol_ask_yes_no()` with proper thread safety

**Testing**:
```bash
# Test SFTP connection (will now show host key dialog properly)
./gFTP.app/Contents/MacOS/gftp-gtk
# Connect to: sftp://user@hostname
```

## 2024-12-12 - macOS Improvements

### Fixed: Application Hangs on Ctrl-C (SIGINT)

**Problem**: When pressing Ctrl-C or using "Force Quit" from macOS Finder, gftp-gtk would hang and not exit properly. The signal handler would print debug messages repeatedly but never terminate the application.

**Solution**: Added GTK-specific signal handler that properly quits the application:
- Created `_gftp_gtk_signal_handler()` in `src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c`
- Calls `_gftp_exit()` which performs proper cleanup (saves settings, disconnects)
- Overrides the common signal handler from `src/uicommon/gftpui.c`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c:180-189` - Added signal handler
- `src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c:1498` - Installed signal handler in main()

**Testing**:
```bash
/Users/sedwards/source/jhbuild/install/bin/gftp-gtk
# Press Ctrl-C - application now exits cleanly
```

### Added: Relocatable Translations for macOS App Bundles

**Problem**: gFTP translations were hardcoded to install-time paths, making it difficult to create relocatable macOS application bundles. Users wanted translations to work when the app is moved anywhere on the system.

**Solution**: Implemented runtime detection of app bundles using CoreFoundation:

1. **CoreFoundation Integration**
   - Added framework dependency in `meson.build`
   - Defines `HAVE_COREFOUNDATION` when available on macOS

2. **Runtime Locale Detection**
   - Modified `gftp_locale_init()` to detect if running from app bundle
   - Uses `CFBundleGetMainBundle()` and `CFBundleCopyResourcesDirectoryURL()`
   - Automatically finds translations in `gFTP.app/Contents/Resources/locale/`
   - Falls back to traditional `LOCALE_DIR` if not in bundle

3. **App Bundle Packaging**
   - Created `create_app_bundle.sh` script
   - Packages gftp-gtk binary and all 64 translations
   - Generates proper `Info.plist`

**Files Modified**:
- `meson.build:40-47` - Added CoreFoundation framework
- `lib/misc.c:28-31` - Added CoreFoundation headers
- `lib/misc.c:965-1000` - Modified locale initialization

**Files Added**:
- `create_app_bundle.sh` - App bundle packaging script
- `README.AppBundle.md` - Complete documentation

**App Bundle Structure**:
```
gFTP.app/
├── Contents/
│   ├── Info.plist
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── gftp-gtk
│   └── Resources/
│       └── locale/
│           ├── es/LC_MESSAGES/gftp.mo
│           ├── fr/LC_MESSAGES/gftp.mo
│           └── ... (64 locales)
```

**Usage**:
```bash
# Create app bundle
cd ~/source/jhbuild/checkout/gftp
./create_app_bundle.sh

# Test it
open gFTP.app

# Test with Spanish translations
LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 ./gFTP.app/Contents/MacOS/gftp-gtk
```

**Benefits**:
- ✓ Fully relocatable - bundle works anywhere
- ✓ Self-contained - all 64 translations included
- ✓ No wrapper scripts or environment variables needed
- ✓ Backward compatible with traditional Unix installs
- ✓ Minimal code changes (~30 lines)

## Summary

These changes make gFTP much more macOS-friendly:

1. **Better User Experience**: Application responds properly to quit signals
2. **Modern Packaging**: Supports standard macOS app bundle conventions
3. **Internationalization**: All 64 translations work out of the box
4. **Distribution Ready**: App bundle can be distributed as-is or packaged in DMG

Both features maintain full backward compatibility with traditional Unix installations and don't affect the text-mode client.

✓ COMPLETED: Relocatable translations for macOS app bundles

Implementation:
- Added CoreFoundation framework support in meson.build
- Modified gftp_locale_init() to detect app bundle at runtime
- Automatically loads translations from gFTP.app/Contents/Resources/locale/
- Falls back to traditional install location if not in bundle
- Created create_app_bundle.sh script to package translations

Result:
- gFTP.app now includes all 64 locales
- Translations are relocatable - bundle can be moved anywhere
- No wrapper scripts or environment variables needed
- Backward compatible with traditional Unix installs

See README.AppBundle.md for complete documentation
